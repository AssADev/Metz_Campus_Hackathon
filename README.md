# Metz Campus - Hackathon N°1 (2020)

This project was made in **4 days**, during my first hackathon at ÉSTIAM Metz Campus, and the objective was to create a website to describe each training course of Metz Campus.

The live preview is available [here](https://assadev.github.io/Metz_Campus_Hackathon/src/html/index.html), have fun.
